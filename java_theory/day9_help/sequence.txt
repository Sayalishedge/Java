Employee extends Object
It HAS NOT overridden equals method
state : id : int , name ,sal

Emp e1=new Emp(100,"abc",12345);
Emp e2=new Emp(100,"abc",12345);
sop(e1==e2);//f
sop(e1.equals(e2));//f


Equality : 2 emps are same iff empId n name are same

3. Enumeration
refer :  readme



eg :
public enum Color
{RED,GREEN,BLUE}

What is it ? : keyword to represent set of related self typed constants.
It's a special class generated by javac that implicitly extends from ---java.lang.Enum

Access specifier of the Implicitly added  constructor : private
which are the args of the ctor : 2 , string name , int ordinal pos
1st n only statement in the ctor : super(name,pos)

Data Members : 3 fields
public static final Color RED,GREEN,BLUE;


Important Methods : 
Inherited methods from Enum : 
public int ordinal()
public String toString() : rets name of the enum constant
public String name() : rets name of the enum constant
....
+ javac synthesized methods
1. public static Color[] values()
2. public static Color valueOf(String clr) throws IllegalArgumentException 


Can you add enum nested within a class or interface ? YES (implicitly it's treated as static member)
eg : class Vehicle
{
  ....
 private Color clr;
    enum Color
  {RED,GREEN,BLUE}
}

How to access BLUE ? Vehicle.Color.BLUE

Can you add , additional state , constructor , methods to the enum ?  yes


Objective : Showroom Management system , which will keep track of vehicles added in the showroom.

Objective : Accept vehicle details : chasisNo(string) : Unique ID, color(enum) , basePrice(double) , manufactureDate(LocalDate),company,isAvailable

eg : Suppose vehicle's base price increases as per the chosen color

How will you implement it ?
enum Color
{RED(5000),GREEN(8000),BLUE(4500)}

Add  validation rules
4.1 No dup vehicles should be added in the showroom 
4.2 manufactureDate : must be after 1st Jan 2020
4.3 Vehicle color must be valid

0. Prompt showroom capacity
Create suitable array.

Options
1. Add Vehicle to the showroom.
Accept data --validate all i/ps --in case of success -- add vehicle , to the showroom.
o.w : throw custom exception

2. Display all vehicle details

0. Exit
